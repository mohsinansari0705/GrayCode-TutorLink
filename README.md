## Problem Definition

**Current Gap:**
Traditional e-learning platforms are either too static (only reading/watching videos) or lack personalization in how students interact with the content. Students also struggle with practical assessments — especially in cases where offline (paper-based) work still needs to be evaluated.
Existing platforms rarely combine personalized AI tutoring, flexible learning modes, and hybrid assessment (online + offline) with instant evaluation in one unified experience.

**The Problem:**
Students need an engaging, adaptable, and intelligent platform where they can learn in their preferred style, practice interactively, and get immediate feedback on assessments, whether those assessments are conducted online or offline.

**Why it matters:**
- Personalization boosts engagement and comprehension.
- Hybrid exam evaluation bridges the gap between traditional and digital education.
- Immediate feedback helps students identify and work on weak areas faster.
- A unified platform reduces the need for multiple disconnected learning tools.

**Our Goal:**
To build a platform that offers two distinct learning modes — conversational AI avatar tutoring & reading curated articles/publications — followed by AI-assisted assessments that work both online and via uploaded paper exam photos, giving instant feedback and analytics.

## 1. Problem Definition

Traditional e-learning platforms often lack personalization, engagement, and flexibility.
Students have different learning preferences — some want interactive conversation, while others prefer reading structured material.
Assessment systems are mostly either fully online or offline, creating a gap in hybrid evaluation.

#### Key Gaps:
- No single platform that combines personalized AI tutoring + content reading.
- Lack of hybrid exam evaluation (both online and offline paper grading).
- Delayed or no feedback on paper-based exams.
- Limited adaptability to student preferences.

## 2. Objective

1. Build a dual-mode learning platform where students can:
- Learn by interacting with a customizable AI avatar.
- Learn by reading curated articles/publications.

2. Enable practice and assessments through:
- Online exams (MCQ & short answer, auto-graded).
- Offline paper exams (photo upload → OCR → auto-grading).

3. Provide instant feedback and performance analytics.
